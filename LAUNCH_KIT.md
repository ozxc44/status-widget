## Pre-Flight Checklist

### ✅ Ready
- [x] GitHub repo exists and is public
- [x] README is clear and compelling
- [x] MIT license displayed
- [x] One-click deploy buttons (Railway, Render, Glitch)
- [x] Clear value proposition ("$49/month is too much")

### ⚠️ Demo URL Issue
- [ ] **Demo URL status**: https://status.zhuzeyang.xyz — **DOWN (000)**
- [ ] GitHub Pages: https://ozxc44.github.io/status-widget/ — **404**

**Decision**: Launch without live demo, emphasize one-click deploy instead.

**Reasoning**:
- One-click deploy to Railway takes 30 seconds — that's the demo
- HN users prefer trying things themselves anyway
- "No credit card required" is more compelling than a screenshot

## HN Launch Copy (Ready to Post)

### URL to Submit
https://github.com/ozxc44/status-widget

### Title (Copy Exactly)
```
Show HN: Status Widget — A free alternative to Statuspage.io
```

### Text (Copy Exactly)
```
Hi HN,

I needed a status page for my side project. Statuspage.io costs $49/month. That's more than my project makes.

So I built Status Widget — a free, self-hosted HTTP monitoring tool with an embeddable status widget.

Key features:
- HTTP monitoring every 60 seconds
- One-line embed code for any site
- Real-time status, response time, uptime %
- One-click deploy to Railway/Render/Cloudflare Workers (no credit card required)
- MIT licensed, self-hosted

GitHub: https://github.com/ozxc44/status-widget

It's minimal by design — just enough for early-stage projects that don't want to pay $588/year.

Would love feedback from the community.
```

## Post-Launch: Reply Templates

### If someone mentions Uptime Kuma
```
Great question! Uptime Kuma is awesome for full monitoring.

Status Widget is different:
- Focus: Embeddable status widget vs full monitoring dashboard
- Setup: 30-second one-click deploy vs Docker setup
- Size: Minimal vs comprehensive

If you need full monitoring with alerts, Uptime Kuma is better.
If you just want a quick status widget for your site, Status Widget might be enough.
```

### If someone asks about demo
```
No live demo right now, but you can deploy your own in 30 seconds:
- Click the "Deploy on Railway" button in the README
- No credit card required
- Literally one click

HN users prefer trying things themselves anyway :)
```

### If someone asks why not use X
```
Happy to hear what you're using! I built this because:
1. Statuspage.io is too expensive for side projects
2. Uptime Kuma is overkill if you just need a simple status widget
3. I wanted something I could embed with one line of code

What's your current setup?
```

### If someone suggests a feature
```
Great idea! I've created a GitHub issue to track this:
https://github.com/ozxc44/status-widget/issues/[NUMBER]

Feel free to upvote or add more details there.

## Monitoring (First 4 Hours After Post)

**Check every 15 minutes**:
- [ ] HN post position (is it rising?)
- [ ] New comments — reply to ALL within 15 min
- [ ] GitHub stars — track in notes
- [ ] GitHub traffic (if available)

**Reply strategy**:
1. First hour: Reply to every comment within 5-10 minutes
2. Be humble, acknowledge competitors
3. Ask questions to learn from feedback
4. Create GitHub issues for feature requests

---

## Emergency Contacts / Plan B

### If post gets no traction after 2 hours
- Possible reason: Bad timing, caught in spam filter, or just not interesting
- Plan B: Wait 3 days, try Reddit r/SideProject with different angle

### If post gets negative feedback
- Don't argue
- Acknowledge valid criticism
- Ask: "What would make this actually useful for you?"

### If demo becomes critical
- Quick deploy a Railway instance and update README
- Railway free tier is sufficient for demo traffic
