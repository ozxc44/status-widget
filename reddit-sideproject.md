Show HN alternative: I built a free status page widget because Statuspage.io costs $49/month

## Body
Hi everyone,

I needed a simple status page for my side project. The problem? Statuspage.io starts at $49/month. That's more than my project makes.

So I built **Status Widget** — a free, self-hosted alternative:

**What it does:**
- Monitors HTTP endpoints every 60 seconds
- Gives you a one-line embed code for your website
- Shows real-time status, response time, and uptime %
- You can deploy it free on Railway/Render/Cloudflare Workers (no credit card needed)

**Why I built it:**
Early-stage projects don't need enterprise features. They just need a simple "is my site up?" badge. Paying $588/year for that is crazy.

**Tech stack:**
- Cloudflare Workers / Deno (serverless)
- Pure JavaScript
- MIT licensed (fully self-hosted)

Live demo and embed instructions in the README.

Would love feedback from other indie hackers — is this something you'd use?
