Show HN: Status Widget — A free alternative to Statuspage.io

---
TEXT (copy exactly) ---
Hi HN,

I needed a status page for my side project. Statuspage.io costs $49/month. That's more than my project makes.

So I built Status Widget — a free, self-hosted HTTP monitoring tool with an embeddable status widget.

Key features:
- HTTP monitoring every 60 seconds
- One-line embed code for any site
- Real-time status, response time, uptime %
- One-click deploy to Railway/Render/Cloudflare Workers (no credit card required)
- MIT licensed, self-hosted

GitHub: https://github.com/ozxc44/status-widget

It's minimal by design — just enough for early-stage projects that don't want to pay $588/year.

Would love feedback from the community.
